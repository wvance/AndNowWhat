# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# companies = Company.create([{name:'BlackBox', company_type:'Startup'}, {name:'BlueBird', company_type:'Corperation'}])
# comployees = Employee.create([{email:"wesley.vance@mac.com", first_name:"Wesley", last_name:"Vance"},{email:"jamie.vance@mac.com", first_name:"Jamie", last_name:"Vance"}])
# applications = Application.create([{},{}])
